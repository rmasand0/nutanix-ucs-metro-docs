# Module 1: Introduction to Metro Availability

## Executive Summary
[cite_start]Enterprises deploy Nutanix Metro Clusters to achieve zero-downtime resiliency. [cite: 4] [cite_start]This architecture enables continuous operations between two physically separate sites, ensuring that if one site fails, the other can take over without data loss. [cite: 3]


### Core Technical Pillars
* [cite_start]**Active-Active Architecture:** Storage is presented as a single stretched container, allowing for live data protection. [cite: 5]
* [cite_start]**Hypervisor Flexibility:** Support for both AHV and ESXi environments. [cite: 8]
* [cite_start]**Cisco Operating Modes:** This guide covers integration with: [cite: 10]
    * [cite_start]**IMM:** Intersight Managed Mode. [cite: 11]
    * [cite_start]**ISM:** Intersight Standalone Mode. [cite: 12]
    * [cite_start]**UCSM:** Fabric Interconnect Managed Mode. [cite: 13]

### Baseline Requirements
To successfully complete this deployment, engineers should have a firm grasp of:
1. [cite_start]**AOS Fundamentals:** Distributed Storage Fabric logic. [cite: 7]
2. [cite_start]**Networking Essentials:** VLAN tagging and multi-site routing. [cite: 9]
