# Module 2: Metro Availability Overview

## Replication Fundamentals
[cite_start]Metro Availability provides **Zero-RPO synchronous replication**. [cite: 15] [cite_start]Unlike Async (Snapshot-based) or NearSync (Minute-level), every write must be acknowledged by both clusters before the application proceeds. [cite: 15, 16]

### The Witness: The "Third Site" Rule
[cite_start]The Witness VM is the most critical component for automated site failover. [cite: 19] 
* [cite_start]**Role:** Acts as an arbitrator to prevent "split-brain" scenarios. [cite: 19]
* [cite_start]**Quorum:** In a network partition, the Witness determines which site remains Active. [cite: 19]
* [cite_start]**Placement:** Must reside in a separate failure domain from Site A and Site B. [cite: 72, 73]

### Consistency Groups
[cite_start]Applications consisting of multiple VMs (e.g., App, Web, and Database tiers) must be grouped into **Consistency Groups** to ensure all VMs are replicated at the exact same point-in-time state. [cite: 18, 80]
